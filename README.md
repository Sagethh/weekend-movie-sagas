## Description

I decided to do something I have wanted to do since pretty much the start of my full stack career - use modals!

Rather that making routes and redirecting to various pages on click, I decided to instead pop up a modal with all the same information when the movie poster is clicked.

I also made a modal for the Add Movie button, popping up a little form that holds the data and sending it off when submit is hit.

I think it turned out nicely, really proud of my fist single page application!
